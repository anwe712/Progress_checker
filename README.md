# Progress_checker
This code counts the number of video files (.mp4, .mov, .mkv) and image files (.jpg, .jpeg) in a specified directory path. It also prints the list of files in the directory and the number of pictures and videos found. The datetime module is imported to only consider files created on the current day. just put the correct local path of the folder :)

This code imports necessary modules such as os, datetime, and pywhatkit. It then sets a recipient's phone number, hour, minute, and message to be sent using pywhatkit. The code then checks for the number of pictures and videos created today in a specified directory using os module and datetime module. Finally, it prints the progress of the day and sends a message to the recipient using pywhatkit.
